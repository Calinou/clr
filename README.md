# clr

**Get information about colors and convert them in the command line.**

## Use cases

- As HSL colors are easier to reason about by humans, you want to use an
  HSL color in software that only accepts RGB colors or hexadecimal
  color codes.
- You want to perform color manipulation to derive a color scheme from
  a base color.

## Installation

and [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) (bundled with Nim),
enter the following commands in a terminal:
